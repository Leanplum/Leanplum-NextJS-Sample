This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project that is instrumented with Leanplum tracking.

### Implementation details

- The layout component `components/layout.js` is used by both `pages/index.js` and `pages/products/index.js`.
- The layout includes a dynamic component that loads the Leanplum SDK, `components/tracking.js`.
- When included, the tracking component sets up the SDK options, starts a user session, and tracks a page view event.

The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
